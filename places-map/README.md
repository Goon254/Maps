MY world Explorer

This is a React app I built that lets me mark and keep track of all the places I’ve lived, visited, or want to go someday. I wanted something fun and interactive, so I used a map that I can click on to add my own personal markers. Each time I click, a form pops up where I can enter details like the name of the place, a short description, when I was there, and even a few personal notes.

The app makes it easy to see all my locations on the map with colorful markers. I can also view everything I’ve added in a simple list on the side. When I’m done adding places, I can switch to view-only mode so I can explore what I’ve added. There’s also a reset button that clears everything in case I want to start over..

Features

I can click anywhere on the map to add a new location.
I can give each location a name, category, and description, and include details like years or notes.
All locations appear both as map markers and in a list on the side.
I can hide or show the list of locations anytime.
When I’m done adding places, I can switch to view-only mode or reset the whole map to start again.

Technologies I Used

React for the main structure of the app.
Leaflet and React Leaflet for the map and markers.
OpenStreetMap for the map data.
UUID for creating unique IDs for each location.
CSS for styling and layout.

How It Works

When I click on the map, a pop-up form appears. I fill in the name of the place, choose a category (like lived, visited, want to visit, or favorite), and add any extra notes or memories. After I save, the marker shows up on the map, and I can also see it listed in the sidebar. Clicking on a marker brings up all the details again in a small popup.

Design

I wanted the design to feel simple and clean. The layout adjusts nicely whether I’m using it on a laptop or a phone. Each category has its own color badge, and I kept the buttons and text easy to read and understand.

What I Learned

I learned how to work with React Leaflet and manage map events like clicks. I also got better at handling state in React and organizing multiple components that work together. One of the biggest challenges was getting the Leaflet icons to display properly, but I figured out how to fix that using custom icon settings.

I also learned how to think through user experience—making sure that adding, viewing, and resetting locations all feel smooth and natural.

Credits

Thanks to Leaflet and OpenStreetMap for the free map tools, and to React for making it so easy to build something interactive.
Id also love to credit AI for the direction and guidance in crafting the idea for this project.
