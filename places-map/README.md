## Key Components

### App.js
- Main application component
- Manages application state (locations, UI modes)
- Handles map interactions and location management

### MapClickHandler
- Custom component to handle map click events
- Only active when in "adding locations" mode

### LocationModal
- Modal form for entering location details
- Validates required fields
- Generates unique IDs for locations

### LocationList
- Displays all added locations in a sidebar
- Toggleable visibility
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Styling and Design

- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with gradient headers
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for tablets and desktop
- **Color-Coded Categories**: Different colors for different location types
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects and hover transitions
- **Accessibility**: Focus states and proper contrast ratios

## Development Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Leaflet Marker Icons
**Problem**: Default Leaflet markers don't display properly in React applications.
**Solution**: Manually configured marker icons with CDN URLs for proper display.

### Challenge 2: Map Click Handling
**Problem**: Need to distinguish between adding locations and viewing mode.
**Solution**: Created a custom `MapClickHandler` component that only responds to clicks when in adding mode.

### Challenge 3: Responsive Design
**Problem**: Map and sidebar layout needed to work on various screen sizes.
**Solution**: Implemented CSS Grid and Flexbox with media queries for mobile-first responsive design.

### Challenge 4: State Management
**Problem**: Managing complex state for locations, UI modes, and modal visibility.
**Solution**: Used React hooks (useState) with clear state structure and proper state updates.
